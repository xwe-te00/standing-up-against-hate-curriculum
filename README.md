# Standing Up Against Hate Curriculum

## Mission Statement

As a Holocaust survivor and educator, I have dedicated my life to sharing the lessons of history and promoting the importance of standing up against hate. This curriculum is born from the belief that education is our most powerful tool to combat prejudice, foster empathy, and cultivate a new generation of "upstanders"—people who choose to speak out and act when they witness injustice.

Our goal is to provide free, high-quality educational materials that teachers, community leaders, and parents worldwide can use to inspire courage, empathy, and moral responsibility. By learning from the past and applying its lessons to the present, we can build a future where hatred and indifference have no place.

## What is an "Upstander"?

An upstander is someone who recognizes when something is wrong and chooses to act. They stand up for others, speak out against injustice, and actively work to create a more just and compassionate community. This curriculum focuses on transforming bystanders into upstanders through historical examples, modern case studies, and practical skill-building.
